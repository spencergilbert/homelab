# Homelab Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for my homelab project.  
This directory captures design decisions, architecture, and operational notes that evolve with the system.

---

## Architecture
See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for a high-level overview of the homelab’s components and topology.

---

## Request for Discussion (RFD) Index

RFDs are numbered sequentially and document significant technical or architectural decisions.

<!-- This section is automatically managed by scripts/rfd.py - do not edit manually -->
<!-- BEGIN RFD INDEX -->
| RFD | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|---------|------|
<!-- END RFD INDEX -->

> RFDs follow the Oxide model — they're living design documents intended to capture context and reasoning over time.

## Goals
- Capture **why** design choices were made.
- Keep documentation close to the code and infrastructure.
- Encourage thoughtful evolution over ad-hoc change.
